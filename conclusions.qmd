# Conclusions {.unnumbered}

In conclusion, the modeling technique of transfer learning serves as the foundational approach for applying models, demonstrating how to make predictions and enhance public policies. This methodology not only provides insights into effective prediction methods but also contributes to the enhancement of public policy frameworks.

A comprehensive framework is necessary for tackling the challenges posed by emerging infectious diseases. Furthermore, the global impact of these diseases necessitates a proactive approach in understanding their dynamics and predicting outbreaks, forming the cornerstone of effective public health strategies.

The objectives of this book outlined the significance of transfer learning techniques in enhancing infectious disease forecasting, especially in scenarios with limited data. Furthermore, the exploration of infectious diseases' impact on health metrics, specifically Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs), adds a critical dimension to the study, by assessing the feasibility of transfer learning in predicting subtle impacts on health metrics.

The proposal's significance for future reserch lies in addressing the gaps in existing studies on transfer learning in epidemic forecasting. While empirical evidence suggests its potential, the aim is to expand this understanding, providing a valuable contribution to the empirical literature.

A meticulous approach, encompassing data collection, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model selection, and rigorous evaluation in collaboration with relevant stakeholders ensured the iterative adaptation of the book to evolving data and scenarios.

The integration of machine learning, particularly transfer learning, brings a transformative dimension to understanding and predicting infectious diseases. The application of these technologies in health metrics analysis holds the potential for more accurate assessments of disease burden.

Dedicated efforts and resources are imperative to fully realize the capabilities of transfer learning and machine learning in addressing global health challenges.
