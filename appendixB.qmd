To set up the environment for replicating the code used in this book the R language is needed as well as R and Rstudio IDE environments. The following sections contain the directions for installing **R** and **RStudio**, how to set up a book with **quarto** and how to use **GitHub** as a version saver source.

## Info on how to setup this project in quarto

[quarto](https://quarto.org/) is the new version of **Rmarkdown**, it can be used for making notes, presentations, websites, books and more.

In this project the book has been made in quarto and version saved on github.

### GitHub useful commands

In RStudio create a new project on a new directory and in terminal type:

    add git
    quarto book project

The automated process will create a `_quarto.yml` file, the top of the file will look like this one:

    project:
      type: book

On terminal type: `quarto preview`

It creates a folder `_book`

#### Add Github later:

source: https://happygitwithr.com/existing-github-last.html

connect with github

create a github repo with the same name from github website

then type

    usethis::use_git()

this pushes all files in R to a remote folder designed to github repo

in terminal connect with the github repo

    git init 
    git remote add origin

https://github.com/Fgazzelloni/infectious.git

    git branch -M main 
    git push -u origin main 

### Publish your book on github pages

change the `quarto.yml` file into:

    project: 
      type: book 
      output-dir: docs 

add a .nojekyll file, type in terminal:

    touch .nojekyll 

then type

    quarto render 

some issues might arise if more than one calculation is made inside a single chunks split the chunks!

quarto render creates a folder `docs`
