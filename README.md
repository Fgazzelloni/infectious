The goal of **infectious** is to introduce you to the **Health Metrics and the Spread of Infectious Diseases: Machine Learning Applications and Spatial Modeling Analysis with R** book written by Federica Gazzelloni.

This book guides you through the modeling representation of the selected real world cases for the identification of the state of health of a population.

A large component of this book is made in R language for spatial/data visualizations and modeling.
