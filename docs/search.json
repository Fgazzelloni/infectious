    "text": "Health metrics and the spread of infectious diseases, with machine learning applications and spatial model analysis, is a manual and a textbook for an introductory health data analysis course. It can also turn out to be a useful source code for both practitioners and data scientists.\nPublic health metrics such as DALYs, YLL, and YLD are expressed in numbers of years of life lost or lived with disabilities whose sum expresses a key value generally used for ranking the health status of a population.\nA focus on the impact of recent infectious disease outbreaks, such as Covid19, on the state of health of the population, will be provided along with the most affected locations. The book is structured with an alternation of text and chunks of code in the R language to let the reader be a practitioner of real-world case studies on the topic.\nTo be more specific, the metrics used to summarize the state of health of a population will be compared across other locations and a prediction level tested on a few key models will be provided. The idea is to use {tidymodels}, and {INLA} as modeling tools. Finally, the material contains some interesting spatial visualization, made using {ggplot2}, {leaflet}, {sf}, {rgdal} R packages, plus other main packages for allowing the user for a wider understanding of the potentiality of the R language for both spatial and health metrics.\nThe book is foreseen for practitioners at early stages and graduated students in STEM."

    "text": "Health metrics are key variables to understand more about the state of health of a population. In this book we’ll talk about how to calculate the numbers of years of life lost (YLLs) and the numbers of years lived with disabilities (YLDs), to finally obtain the key metric of the DALYs which identify the numbers of years of life lost due to death or a disability status, namely disability adjusted life years.\n\nThe numbers of years of life lost by a population in comparison to other countries or to the Global mean trend, is based on the latest study results relative to how the well being of a country is in terms of the definition of a healthy life. To give an example, let’s think about a population whose individuals are living a good life, so defined healthy life measured on life expectancy established to be 80 years on average, as most of the World population meets this as a deadline.\nThe part of the population who do not meet this age, but dies earlier, contributes as a building block of the numbers of years of life lost (YLLs), as well as for all that is related with a healthy living, the numbers of years spent dealing with a disability contribute to increasing the numbers of years lived with disabilities for a country’s population.\nTo establish a healthy life status for a country, meaning the state of health of a population, the sum of the two values YLLs and YLDs is used to obtain the key metric of DALYs. This metric value is used to quickly identify the level of health of a population compared to a Global review based on the latest findings of the most updated studies.\nIn addition, this level is used to improve the proportion of countries who are in need of a better health status recognition. To be more specific, the focus on the numbers of years can help identify the areas where most of the years are lost and need for improvement, whether in facilities, research or investments.\nAn improvement of health at a Global level is reached when the definition of a healthy file is met in most of the countries where it wasn’t before.\nFurthermore, what we want to analyze are a series of data that are produced taking into account the tables of mortality and future life expectancy these are defined as means that these metrics have been considered important for assessing the state of health of one point population\nWhat we refer to are the health metrics and which refer to the number of years lost due to an increase in mortality or in any case to a mortality trend that is above a certain general level which we can consider as the level optimal health globally."

    "text": "3.1 How to use the metrics\nThe health metrics of DALY, YLL, and YLD can be used in several ways to help prioritize public health interventions, evaluate the impact of diseases and injuries, and inform public health decision-making. Some common uses of these metrics include:\nPrioritizing public health interventions: By calculating the overall burden of disease in a population, public health practitioners can prioritize which diseases and injuries to address first. This helps allocate resources and target interventions to the areas of greatest need.\nEvaluating the impact of diseases and injuries: These metrics can be used to measure the impact of diseases and injuries on individuals and populations and to track changes over time. This information can help inform public health decision-making and allocate resources more effectively.\nComparing the burden of disease across populations: DALY, YLL, and YLD can be used to compare the burden of disease across populations and between different regions. This information can help identify disparities in health outcomes and inform targeted public health interventions.\nEvaluating the effectiveness of public health programs: These metrics can be used to evaluate the impact of public health programs and to assess the effectiveness of public health interventions. This information can help public health practitioners identify areas for improvement and make necessary changes to ensure that programs are achieving their goals.\nMonitoring global health trends: DALY, YLL, and YLD can also be used to monitor global health trends and track changes in the burden of disease over time. This information can be used to inform global health policies and allocate resources to address emerging health threats.\nOverall, the health metrics of DALY, YLL, and YLD provide valuable information for public health practitioners, researchers, and policy makers to help prioritize and allocate resources, evaluate the impact of diseases and injuries, and inform public health decision-making."

    "text": "How to use the metrics\nOverview of the causes and risks\n\nConditions and injuries that are associated with the burden of disease and injury vary according to their specific causes and risks. However, some common causes and risk factors include:\n\nLifestyle choices: Poor diet, physical inactivity, tobacco use, and excessive alcohol consumption are major risk factors for many chronic diseases and injuries, including heart disease, stroke, cancer, and liver disease.\nEnvironmental factors: Exposure to pollutants, such as air pollution and toxic chemicals, can increase the risk of certain diseases and injuries.\nInfections: Many diseases, such as tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, and malaria, are caused by infectious agents.\nPoverty: People living in poverty are often more susceptible to health problems due to limited access to healthcare, healthy food, and safe living conditions.\nAging: As people get older, they are at an increased risk of many health problems, including chronic diseases and disabilities.\nGenetics: Some diseases and injuries are caused by genetic factors, such as a genetic predisposition to certain cancers.\nInjuries: Injuries, such as falls, road traffic accidents, and violence, can also contribute to the burden of diseases and injuries.\n\n\nA particular health condition can have multiple causes and risk factors. For example, poverty and lack of access to healthcare can increase the risk of infectious diseases, while poor diet and physical inactivity can increase the risk of chronic diseases. Addressing the underlying causes and risk factors for diseases and injuries is a key component of public health interventions and can help reduce the overall burden of disease.\nAs an example here is shown how the DALY metric can be used for prevention:\nSuppose we have data on the number of cases of a particular disease, as well as the average number of years of life lost due to this disease. We can use this information to calculate the total number of DALYs lost due to this disease.\n\nShow the code# Load the library 'dplyr'\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n# Create a data frame with the number of cases and average years of life lost\ndf <- data.frame(cases = c(100, 200, 300),\n                 years_lost = c(5, 10, 15))\n\n# Calculate the number of DALYs lost\ndf <- df %>% mutate(dalys = cases * years_lost)\n\n# Sum the total number of DALYs lost\ntotal_dalys <- sum(df$dalys)\n\n\nIn this example, we first create a data frame with the number of cases of the disease and the average years of life lost for each case. Then, we use the mutate() function from the dplyr library to calculate the number of DALYs lost for each case. Finally, we use the sum() function to find the total number of DALYs lost for the entire population.\nThis information can be used to inform public health interventions to prevent the spread of this disease and reduce the number of DALYs lost. For example, the information could be used to prioritize resources for disease control and prevention activities, such as health education campaigns, vaccination programs, and screening and treatment programs."
