    "text": "What this book is all about\nHow it can be used\nWhat is the main take away\n\n\n\n\nHealth Metrics and the Spread of Infectious Diseases, featuring machine learning applications and spatial model analysis, serves as a manual and textbook for introductory health data analysis courses. Additionally, it can be a valuable source code for practitioners and data scientists alike.\nThis book provides a set of tools for analyzing data of various types, but it is specifically designed for health data, such as the number of infections in a population or identifying the health status of a country.\nThere are techniques that will be evaluated as the most appropriate for a certain type of analysis, while others, on the contrary, will be deprecated. It will be interesting to see which one is the most valuable for making predictions, while another should just be used for evaluating data consistency.\nPublic health metrics, such as Years of Life Lost (YLL) and Years lived with Disability (YLD), are examples of the key metrics discussed and used throughout this book. They are expressed in number of years of life lost or years lived with disabilities, and their sum represents a crucial value named Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs). DALYs are generally used for ranking the health status of a population. The book covers the history of the development of health metrics and suggests alternatives, providing insights for health policymakers.\nTo be more specific, the book compares the metrics used to summarize the health status of a population across different locations. It also tests prediction levels using key models. The initial tools are {tidymodels} and {INLA} for modeling, but other machine learning packages like {mlr3} and {caret} are also tested.\nIn practice, the data will include information about humanity such as age, sex, life expectancy, mortality, and risk levels. The interesting part is related to the identification of the influence of some of the most dangerous infectious disease on the values of health metrics of a population, and this is done to practice the variation to eventually predict through model transfer techniques same pattern procedure on other countries. It’s not the only application; more examples of model transfer applications are needed in research. (cit)\nA focus on the impact of recent infectious disease outbreaks, such as SARS-Covid19, on the state of health of the population, will be provided along with the most affected locations to compare results of both deterministic and stochastic (Bayesian) models. Risk factor analysis, also cover an important part of this book and aims at identifying the connection that would lead to an increase on the number of DALYs for specific population and look at providing suggestion for public health policy and practice (Vos et al., 2020).\nThe book is structured with an alternation of text and chunks of code, primarily in the R programming language; hints for translations in python is in appendix C. This is done to let the reader be a practitioner of real-world case studies on the topic.\nThe material supports full exploratory data analysis and model data visualization, it contains the code for making some interesting spatial visualization, made using {ggplot2}, {leaflet}, {sf}, {rgdal} R packages, plus other main packages for theme user customization. The main reason is to unlock the potentiality of the R language for a wider understanding of both spatial and health metrics.\nThe book is foreseen for practitioners at early stages and graduated students in STEM, but it will be useful for experts in the field who would love to have all the tools in one place to scan through as needed.\nThe purpose of this book is to contribute to the scientific development of the field of metrics and evaluation (Murray & Frenk, 2008). It is divided in four main sections, each containing three chapters. The first section Metrics and Evaluation is introductory explaining the health metrics definition at first level, the second section Modeling goes a bit more inside the topic looking at the tools available, the third section Data Visualization allows the user to be able to visualize the results of the analysis, and finally the fourth section makes the things into practice providing Case Studies.\nIn particular, in the first section, the first chapter Health Metrics dives into the different type of metrics, YLLs, YLDs, and DALYs, along with their history of development, provides a definition of the metrics and their usage. In this section there is also a mention of a fourth metric, the HALY or the Health Adjusted Life Years, this is a further improvement made in the development of the metrics and evaluation sector.\nThe second chapter Metrics Components looks at the key building blocks of the health metrics as important set of components for assuring consistency and to make sure that the values released are able to picture the real health status of a population. The key components are life tables, life expectancy, the mortality level, and the weights of disabilities. This chapter is supported by the appendix A where the beyond of the calculations are further explained.\nThe third chapter evaluates the Causes and Risks that are involved with the possibility of the metrics increase in values, even in terms of identifying the most dangerous enemies acting in favor of it. Risks are also considered in order to stimulate alternative solutions for prevention and health policy development.\nThe second section of the book is the the second level dive into the metrics evaluation, it is Modeling. A set of tools available for analyzing trends, or phenomenon to catch missing values and attempt filling the missing data to provide an overall picture of the general trend. In the first chapter Techniques there is an overview of the different types of models that would be suitable to use, the second chapter Packages selects some of the R-packages to use for modeling. Then chapter three shows how to make Predictions.\nThe third section of the book is all focused on Data Visualization, the first chapter shows the Application, the second chapter applies Spatial Visualization into modeling results. Then, the third chapter further allows the reader to be able to improve the knowledge acquired with some tailored examples.\nThe fourth section of the book, Case Studies presents two main case studies, one is Covid19 and the other one is the case of Malaria. To eventually summarize the variation of the health metrics when these two infectious diseases affect the population.\nIn Conclusion, the technique of modeling transfer learning shows as the foundation of model application how to make prediction and to improve public policies.\n\n\n\n\nMurray, C.

    "text": "The history of health metrics\nThe history of health metrics is a fascinating journey that spans centuries, evolving from rudimentary observations to sophisticated statistical methods. One of the earliest forms of health metrics can be traced back to the work of John Graunt, an Englishman, in the 17th century (johngra2024?).\nIn 1662, Graunt published a landmark work titled “Natural and Political Observations Made upon the Bills of Mortality.” Graunt was not a physician but a haberdasher, and his interest in mortality data was driven by the Bills of Mortality, which were weekly and annual records of deaths in London. These bills were maintained by the Worshipful Company of Parish Clerks and provided information on the number of births and deaths in the city.\nGraunt meticulously analyzed this mortality data and produced tables that presented various patterns and trends. His work laid the foundation for modern demography and statistical analysis. Among his notable contributions were the concepts of life expectancy and mortality rates.\nOne of Graunt’s key observations was the consistent pattern of higher mortality among infants and young children. He noted the difference in life expectancy between males and females and provided insights into factors influencing mortality, such as epidemics and seasons.\nOver time, advancements in mathematics, medicine, and statistics led to the development of more sophisticated health metrics. The 19th century saw the emergence of life tables, which provided a systematic way to analyze mortality and life expectancy. With the growth of epidemiology in the 20th century, health metrics expanded to include measures like Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) and Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs), capturing not just mortality but also the impact of diseases on overall health and well-being.\nIn the contemporary era, the integration of computing power and big data has further transformed health metrics. Today, we have complex models, machine learning algorithms, and global health databases that allow for real-time tracking of diseases and health outcomes.\nJohn Graunt’s work may have been a humble beginning, but it set in motion a scientific approach to understanding population health. The journey from Graunt’s Bills of Mortality (johngra2024a?) to today’s sophisticated health metrics reflects the continuous quest to quantify and comprehend the complexities of human health and disease.\n\n\nQuality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs)\nThe concept of Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) emerged in the late 1970s, originating from the idea of combining both the quantity and quality of life by Joseph S. Pliskin, then it became a widely used metric for evaluating the cost-effectiveness of healthcare interventions (quality-2023?). One QALY corresponds to one year in perfect health, it ranges from 1 (perfect health) to 0 (dead). However, this metric, used in various sectors such as health insurance, is somewhat criticized due to its lack of addressing disparities among individuals. It might result in discrimination against individuals with specific medical conditions or disabilities.\nA controversial result followed 25 years of research and studies due to the concerning validity of the metric to be inclusive. Started in the early 1989s, to step in the 2010 with the European Commission (echoutco2016?) which started the largest-ever study specifically dedicated to testing the assumptions of the QALY (holmes2013?), ending in 2013 with the recommended not using QALYs in healthcare decision making, arguing that patients with disabilities are valued less under a QALY-based system then individuals with no disabilites. The result was then further criticized and it is still on debate.\n\n\nDisability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs)\nIt was in the 1990s when the World Bank financed a study at Harvard University to develop a sustainable index capable of considering not only the health status but also identifying the level of disabilities concerned by disparities. A new way of comparing the overall health and life expectancy of different countries was released along with the Global Burden of Disease Study in 1990 (murray1994?), a project involving Christopher J. L. Murray (christop2024?) and Alan Lopez (alanlop2023?), in collaboration with the World Health Organization (WHO), the Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) (disabili2023a?). A metric that combines years of life lost due to premature death and years lived with disability.\nHence DALYs share a connection with the quality-adjusted life year (QALY) metric, however, while QALYs specifically represent an individual measure focusing on the benefits with and without medical intervention, the DALYs consider the overall burden of diseases.\nThe metric of DALYs is obtained by the sum of the numbers of years of life lost (YLLs) and the numbers of years lived with disabilities (YLDs), and it identify the numbers of years of life lost due to death or a disability status.\nThe numbers of years of life lost by a population in comparison to other countries or to the Global mean trend, is based on the latest study results relative to how the well being of a country is in terms of the definition of a healthy life. To give an example, let’s think about a population whose individuals are living a good life, so defined healthy life measured on life expectancy established to be 80 years on average, as most of the World population meets this as a deadline.\nThe part of the population who do not meet this age, but dies earlier, contributes as a building block of the numbers of years of life lost (YLLs), as well as for all that is related with a healthy living, the numbers of years spent dealing with a disability contribute to increasing the numbers of years lived with disabilities for a country’s population.\nTo establish a healthy life status for a country, meaning the state of health of a population, the sum of the two values YLLs and YLDs is used to obtain the key metric of DALYs. This metric value is used to quickly identify the level of health of a population compared to a Global review based on the latest findings of the most updated studies.\nIn addition, this level is used to improve the proportion of countries who are in need of a better health status recognition. To be more specific, the focus on the numbers of years can help identify the areas where most of the years are lost and need for improvement, whether in facilities, research or investments.\nAn improvement of health at a Global level is reached when the definition of a healthy file is met in most of the countries where it wasn’t before.\nFurthermore, what we want to analyze are a series of data that are produced taking into account the tables of mortality and future life expectancy these are defined as means that these metrics have been considered important for assessing the state of health of one point population\nWhat we refer to are the health metrics and which refer to the number of years lost due to an increase in mortality or in any case to a mortality trend that is above a certain general level which we can consider as the level optimal health globally.",

Some common uses of these metrics include:\nPrioritizing public health interventions: By calculating the overall burden of disease in a population, public health practitioners can prioritize which diseases and injuries to address first. This helps allocate resources and target interventions to the areas of greatest need.\nEvaluating the impact of diseases and injuries: These metrics can be used to measure the impact of diseases and injuries on individuals and populations and to track changes over time. This information can help inform public health decision-making and allocate resources more effectively.\nComparing the burden of disease across populations: DALY, YLL, and YLD can be used to compare the burden of disease across populations and between different regions. This information can help identify disparities in health outcomes and inform targeted public health interventions.\nEvaluating the effectiveness of public health programs: These metrics can be used to evaluate the impact of public health programs and to assess the effectiveness of public health interventions. This information can help public health practitioners identify areas for improvement and make necessary changes to ensure that programs are achieving their goals.\nMonitoring global health trends: DALY, YLL, and YLD can also be used to monitor global health trends and track changes in the burden of disease over time. This information can be used to inform global health policies and allocate resources to address emerging health threats.\nOverall, the health metrics of DALY, YLL, and YLD provide valuable information for public health practitioners, researchers, and policy makers to help prioritize and allocate resources, evaluate the impact of diseases and injuries, and inform public health decision-making.",

    "text": "2.0.1 YLLs components\nThe number of years of life lost YLLs is the first of the three metrics that is calculated, and is important for releasing a first look at the status of a population. It is calculated for identifying the area where improvement is required for reducing the loss in health status and clearly reducing the probability of death (Reiner & Hay, 2022)\nThe components of YLL (Years of Life Lost) include several factors that contribute to the calculation of premature death due to a disease or injury. These components are:\nAge at death: The age at which a person died due to a disease or injury is a crucial component of YLL. The earlier the age at death, the greater the impact on potential years of life lost.\nLife expectancy: The expected age at death in a population without the disease or injury is an important component of YLL. This value is used to compare the actual age at death with the expected age at death and determine the number of years of life lost.\nStandard life expectancy: To make comparisons across populations and over time, YLL is often expressed relative to a standard life expectancy, typically set at an age of 70 years.\nPopulation size: The size of the population affected by a disease or injury is another important component of YLL. A larger population will have a greater impact on overall YLL, regardless of the age at death.\nCause of death: The cause of death is also considered when calculating YLL, as different causes may have different impacts on potential years of life lost.\nBy taking these factors into account, YLL provides a measure of the potential years of life lost due to premature death caused by a disease or injury. It is an important component of the DALY, which provides a comprehensive view of the overall burden of disease on a population.",

However, some common causes and risk factors include:\n\nLifestyle choices: Poor diet, physical inactivity, tobacco use, and excessive alcohol consumption are major risk factors for many chronic diseases and injuries, including heart disease, stroke, cancer, and liver disease.\nEnvironmental factors: Exposure to pollutants, such as air pollution and toxic chemicals, can increase the risk of certain diseases and injuries.\nInfections: Many diseases, such as tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, and malaria, are caused by infectious agents.\nPoverty: People living in poverty are often more susceptible to health problems due to limited access to healthcare, healthy food, and safe living conditions.\nAging: As people get older, they are at an increased risk of many health problems, including chronic diseases and disabilities.\nGenetics: Some diseases and injuries are caused by genetic factors, such as a genetic predisposition to certain cancers.\nInjuries: Injuries, such as falls, road traffic accidents, and violence, can also contribute to the burden of diseases and injuries.\n\n\nA particular health condition can have multiple causes and risk factors. For example, poverty and lack of access to healthcare can increase the risk of infectious diseases, while poor diet and physical inactivity can increase the risk of chronic diseases. Addressing the underlying causes and risk factors for diseases and injuries is a key component of public health interventions and can help reduce the overall burden of disease.\nAs an example here is shown how the DALY metric can be used for prevention:\nSuppose we have data on the number of cases of a particular disease, as well as the average number of years of life lost due to this disease. We can use this information to calculate the total number of DALYs lost due to this disease.\n\nHide code# Load the library 'dplyr'\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n# Create a data frame with the number of cases and average years of life lost\ndf &lt;- data.frame(YLL = c(5, 10, 15),\n                 YLD = c(1,3,4))\n\n# Calculate the number of DALYs lost\ndf &lt;- df %&gt;% mutate(DALY = YLL + YLD)\n\n# Sum the total number of DALYs lost\ntotal_dalys &lt;- sum(df$DALY)\ntotal_dalys\n\n#&gt; [1] 38\n\n\nIn this example, the number of cases of the disease and the average years of life lost for each case are used to calculate the number of DALYs lost for each case. Finally, the total number of DALYs lost for the entire population.\nThis information can be used to inform public health interventions to prevent the spread of this disease and reduce the number of DALYs lost. For example, the information could be used to prioritize resources for disease control and prevention activities, such as health education campaigns, vaccination programs, and screening and treatment programs.",

    "text": "Overview\nThis chapter provides a simple explanation on how to model a fast growing phenomenon such as in the case of the spread of infectious diseases, or on the contrary how a fast growing little impact can influence the performance of health metrics for some countries but doesn’t affect the Global picture. More specifically, a further look will be provided at the evolution of the infection in some specific countries, and how this influences the overall level of health metrics.\nThe spread of a virus can be seen as a random process, since the number of individuals who are infected at any given time can change randomly. The exact number of individuals who will be infected in the future cannot be determined with certainty, since it depends on various factors such as the contagiousness of the virus, the behavior of individuals, and the efficacy of mitigation measures.\nA deterministic model, on the other hand, could be used to model the spread of a virus under certain conditions, such as a fixed number of individuals, constant contagiousness, and no mitigation measures. This type of model can be used to make predictions about the spread of a virus under certain assumptions, but it will not account for the randomness and uncertainty associated with real-world scenarios.\nIn general, a stochastic process, or random process (Dobrow, 2016) is the type of model which attempt to replicate uncertain outcomes. At opposite, in a deterministic system the outcome is obtained from a given input, and for this reason it is reproducible.\nMost models used to study the spread of a virus are a combination of both deterministic and stochastic models. For example, the SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) model is a deterministic model that describes the dynamics of the spread of a virus, but it also includes stochastic elements such as random interactions between individuals.",

    "text": "10.2 The spread of COVID-19\nHere is a model example of the spread of COVID-19 using a stochastic process. In this example, we’ll use a simple SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered) model to simulate the spread of the virus in a population. The SEIR model divides a population into four compartments based on their status with respect to the virus: susceptible, exposed, infected, and recovered.\nFirst, we’ll load the necessary packages and define some parameters for our model:\n\nHide codelibrary(deSolve)\n\n# Define parameters\nN &lt;- 1e6  # Total population\nbeta &lt;- 0.5  # Transmission rate\ngamma &lt;- 0.1  # Recovery rate\nt_exp &lt;- 5  # Latent period\n\n# Initial conditions\ninit &lt;- c(S = N - 1, E = 1, I = 0, R = 0)\n\n# Define the SEIR model\nseir_model &lt;- function(t, y, parameters) {\n  with(as.list(y), {\n    dS &lt;- -beta * S * I / N\n    dE &lt;- beta * S * I / N - (1 / t_exp) * E\n    dI &lt;- (1 / t_exp) * E - gamma * I\n    dR &lt;- gamma * I\n    return(list(c(dS, dE, dI, dR)))\n  })\n}\n\n\nNext, we’ll use the ode function from the deSolve package to solve the ODEs and simulate the spread of the virus over a period of 365 days:\n\nHide code# Solve the ODEs\ntimes &lt;- seq(0, 365, by = 1)\nresult &lt;- ode(y = init, times = times, func = seir_model)\n\n# Plot the results\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nggplot(as.data.frame(result), aes(time, I, color = \"Infected\")) +\n  geom_line() +\n  geom_line(aes(time, R, color = \"Recovered\")) +\n  geom_line(aes(time, S, color = \"Susceptible\")) +\n  geom_line(aes(time, E, color = \"Exposed\")) +\n  scale_color_discrete(name = \"Compartment\") +\n  labs(x = \"Time (days)\", y = \"Number of individuals\") +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this example, many factors are not taken into account. In reality, the spread of a virus is much more complex and influenced by many factors such as human behavior, government policies, and healthcare systems.\n\n10.2.1 Covid19 modeling\nThe Bayesian Analysis of Infectious Diseases: COVID-19 and Beyond book is a comprehensive resource that covers the use of Bayesian analysis in the modeling of infectious diseases, including COVID-19.\nIn the context of modeling COVID-19 in R, the following steps can be taken:\nDefine the model structure: The first step is to define the model structure, which involves specifying the underlying mechanisms of disease spread and the parameters of interest. For COVID-19, the model structure might include the number of susceptible individuals, the number of infected individuals, the number of recovered individuals, and the rate of disease transmission.\nSpecify the prior distributions: The next step is to specify the prior distributions for the parameters of interest. This involves defining the prior beliefs about the values of the parameters based on available data and expert knowledge. In the case of COVID-19, this might include prior beliefs about the rate of disease transmission, the incubation period, and the rate of recovery.\nCollect data: The next step is to collect relevant data on the spread of the disease. This might include the number of confirmed cases, the number of hospitalizations, and the number of deaths.\nImplement the model in R: Once the model structure and prior distributions have been specified, the model can be implemented in R using a variety of packages, including Stan, JAGS, or MCMCpack.\nEstimate the parameters: The next step is to use the data and the model to estimate the parameters of interest. This can be done using Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, which involve drawing a large number of samples from the posterior distributions of the parameters.\nEvaluate the model: The final step is to evaluate the performance of the model, which involves comparing the model predictions with the observed data and checking the validity of the model assumptions.\nThis is a general outline of the steps involved in modeling COVID-19 in R using Bayesian analysis. The specific details of the implementation will depend on the particular model structure and data being used.\nSuppose we have data on the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in a region for a period of time, and we want to model the spread of the disease.\nStep 1: Define the model structure\nWe can use the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model to describe the spread of the disease, where S represents the number of susceptible individuals, I represents the number of infected individuals, and R represents the number of recovered individuals. The model structure can be described as follows:\n\\[dS/dt = -beta * S * I / N\\] \\[dI/dt = beta * S * I / N - gamma * I\\] \\[dR/dt = gamma * I\\]\nwhere beta is the rate of transmission, gamma is the rate of recovery, and N is the total population.\nStep 2: Specify the prior distributions\nWe can specify the prior distributions for beta and gamma using expert knowledge and available data. For example, we might specify a gamma distribution with a mean of 0.1 and a standard deviation of 0.05 for beta, and a gamma distribution with a mean of 0.05 and a standard deviation of 0.02 for gamma.\nStep 3: Collect data\nWe can collect data on the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the region for a period of time.\nStep 4: Implement the model in R\nWe can use the rstan package in R to implement the model, as follows:\n\nHide code# Load the rethinking package\nlibrary(rethinking)\nlibrary(rstan)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# Load the data\nsource(\"inst/scripts/covid19_sim_data.R\")\ndata &lt;- out\n\n# Define the model\nSIR_model &lt;- function(data) {\n  # Define the priors\n  beta &lt;- dnorm(0, 0.01)\n  gamma &lt;- dnorm(0, 0.01)\n  I0 &lt;- dnorm(0, 0.01)\n\n  # Define the model\n  S &lt;- numeric(length(data$Time))\n  I &lt;- numeric(length(data$Time))\n  R &lt;- numeric(length(data$Time))\n  S[1] &lt;- 1 - I0\n  I[1] &lt;- I0\n  for (t in 2:length(data$Time)) {\n    S[t] &lt;- S[t - 1] - beta * S[t - 1] * I[t - 1]\n    I[t] &lt;- I[t - 1] + beta * S[t - 1] * I[t - 1] - gamma * I[t - 1]\n    R[t] &lt;- R[t - 1] + gamma * I[t - 1]\n  }\n\n  # Likelihood\n  dpois(data$y, lambda = I)\n}\n\n\nStep 5: Estimate the parameters\nWe can use the sampling function in the rstan package to estimate the parameters, as follows:\n\nHide codedata &lt;- alist(\n  time&lt;- data$time,\n  S&lt;-data$S,\n  I&lt;-data$I,\n  R&lt;-data$R\n)\n\n\nStep 6: Evaluate the model\nWe can evaluate the performance of the model by comparing the model predictions with the observed data and checking the validity\n\nHide code# Plot the observed data and the model predictions\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\npredictions &lt;- extract(results)$I\n\ndata.frame(Time = data$Time, \n           Observed = data$y, \n           Predicted = predictions) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = Time, y = Observed)) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = Predicted, color = \"Predicted\")) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = Observed, color = \"Observed\"), \n            linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  scale_color_discrete(name = NULL, labels = c(\"Predicted\", \"Observed\")) +\n  labs(x = \"Time\", y = \"Number of Confirmed Cases\") +\n  theme_bw()\n\n# Calculate the goodness-of-fit measures\nrmse &lt;- sqrt(mean((data$y - predictions)^2))\nmae &lt;- mean(abs(data$y - predictions))\nr2 &lt;- cor(data$y, predictions)^2\ncat(\"RMSE:\", rmse, \"\\n\")\ncat(\"MAE:\", mae, \"\\n\")\ncat(\"R-squared:\", r2, \"\\n\")\n\n# Plot the posterior distribution of the parameters\nlibrary(bayesplot)\nmcmc_areas(results, pars = c(\"beta\", \"gamma\", \"I0\"),\n           prob = 0.89, ROPE = c(0.05, 0.1),\n           prob_lines = TRUE, prob_args = list(col = \"red\"),\n           rope_args = list(col = \"blue\"),\n           main = \"Posterior Distribution of Parameters\")",

    "text": "In conclusion, the modeling technique of transfer learning serves as the foundational approach for applying models, demonstrating how to make predictions and enhance public policies. This methodology not only provides insights into effective prediction methods but also contributes to the enhancement of public policy frameworks.\nA comprehensive framework is necessary for tackling the challenges posed by emerging infectious diseases. Furthermore, the global impact of these diseases necessitates a proactive approach in understanding their dynamics and predicting outbreaks, forming the cornerstone of effective public health strategies.\nThe objectives of this book outlined the significance of transfer learning techniques in enhancing infectious disease forecasting, especially in scenarios with limited data. Furthermore, the exploration of infectious diseases’ impact on health metrics, specifically Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs), adds a critical dimension to the study, by assessing the feasibility of transfer learning in predicting subtle impacts on health metrics.\nThe proposal’s significance for future reserch lies in addressing the gaps in existing studies on transfer learning in epidemic forecasting. While empirical evidence suggests its potential, the aim is to expand this understanding, providing a valuable contribution to the empirical literature.\nA meticulous approach, encompassing data collection, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model selection, and rigorous evaluation in collaboration with relevant stakeholders ensured the iterative adaptation of the book to evolving data and scenarios.\nThe integration of machine learning, particularly transfer learning, brings a transformative dimension to understanding and predicting infectious diseases. The application of these technologies in health metrics analysis holds the potential for more accurate assessments of disease burden.\nDedicated efforts and resources are imperative to fully realize the capabilities of transfer learning and machine learning in addressing global health challenges.",

    "text": "A.1 Life expectancy\nLife expectancy is the expected number of years a person will live, based on current age and prevailing mortality rates. There are several methods to calculate life expectancy, but one common approach is to use the actuarial life table, which is a statistical table that provides the mortality rates for a population at different ages. The following steps can be used to calculate life expectancy using a life table:\nIdentify the relevant mortality rates for the population and time period of interest. Calculate the probability of surviving to each age, given the mortality rates. Multiply the probability of surviving to each age by the remaining life expectancy at that age to obtain the expected number of years of life remaining at each age. Sum the expected number of years of life remaining at each age to obtain the total life expectancy. Note that life expectancy is a statistical estimate and can be influenced by many factors, such as lifestyle, health, and environmental factors, so actual individual life expectancy can vary widely.\nHere are some key references for calculating life expectancy:\n\nUnited Nations World Population Prospects - The UN provides detailed life tables and population data, including life expectancy, for countries and regions around the world.\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) - The CDC provides life tables for the United States, as well as information on how life expectancy is calculated and factors that affect it.\nWorld Health Organization (WHO) - The WHO provides information on global health and life expectancy, including data and reports on trends in life expectancy and mortality.\nActuarial Science textbooks - Books such as “Actuarial Mathematics” by Bowers, Gerber, Hickman, Jones, and Nesbitt, or “An Introduction to Actuarial Mathematics” by Michel Millar, provide comprehensive coverage of the methods and mathematics used in calculating life expectancy.\nJournal articles - Articles in actuarial and demographic journals, such as the North American Actuarial Journal or Demographic Research, often provide in-depth coverage of the latest research and methods for calculating life expectancy.\n\n\n\n\n\nKovacheva, Ts.
