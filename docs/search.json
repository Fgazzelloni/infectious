    "text": "Health metrics and the spread of infectious diseases, with machine learning applications and spatial model analysis, is a manual and a textbook for an introductory health data analysis course. It can also turn out to be a useful source code for both practitioners and data scientists.\nPublic health metrics such as DALYs, YLL, and YLD are expressed in numbers of years of life lost or lived with disabilities whose sum expresses a key value generally used for ranking the health status of a population.\nA focus on the impact of recent infectious disease outbreaks, such as Covid19, on the state of health of the population, will be provided along with the most affected locations. The book is structured with an alternation of text and chunks of code in the R language to let the reader be a practitioner of real-world case studies on the topic.\nTo be more specific, the metrics used to summarize the state of health of a population will be compared across other locations and a prediction level tested on a few key models will be provided. The idea is to use {tidymodels}, and {INLA} as modeling tools. Finally, the material contains some interesting spatial visualization, made using {ggplot2}, {leaflet}, {sf}, {rgdal} R packages, plus other main packages for allowing the user for a wider understanding of the potentiality of the R language for both spatial and health metrics.\nThe book is foreseen for practitioners at early stages and graduated students in STEM."

    "text": "Health metrics are key variables to understand more about the state of health of a population. In this book we’ll talk about how to calculate the numbers of years of life lost (YLLs) and the numbers of years lived with disabilities (YLDs), to finally obtain the key metric of the DALYs which identify the numbers of years of life lost due to death or a disability status, namely disability adjusted life years.\n\nThe numbers of years of life lost by a population in comparison to other countries or to the Global mean trend, is based on the latest study results relative to how the well being of a country is in terms of the definition of a healthy life. To give an example, let’s think about a population whose individuals are living a good life, so defined healthy life measured on life expectancy established to be 80 years on average, as most of the World population meets this as a deadline.\nThe part of the population who do not meet this age, but dies earlier, contributes as a building block of the numbers of years of life lost (YLLs), as well as for all that is related with a healthy living, the numbers of years spent dealing with a disability contribute to increasing the numbers of years lived with disabilities for a country’s population.\nTo establish a healthy life status for a country, meaning the state of health of a population, the sum of the two values YLLs and YLDs is used to obtain the key metric of DALYs. This metric value is used to quickly identify the level of health of a population compared to a Global review based on the latest findings of the most updated studies.\nIn addition, this level is used to improve the proportion of countries who are in need of a better health status recognition. To be more specific, the focus on the numbers of years can help identify the areas where most of the years are lost and need for improvement, whether in facilities, research or investments.\nAn improvement of health at a Global level is reached when the definition of a healthy file is met in most of the countries where it wasn’t before.\nFurthermore, what we want to analyze are a series of data that are produced taking into account the tables of mortality and future life expectancy these are defined as means that these metrics have been considered important for assessing the state of health of one point population\nWhat we refer to are the health metrics and which refer to the number of years lost due to an increase in mortality or in any case to a mortality trend that is above a certain general level which we can consider as the level optimal health globally."

    "text": "3.1 Components\nThe calculation of YLL (Years of Life Lost) is based on several factors that contribute to premature death. The components are as follows:\nAge at death: The age at which a person dies due to a disease or injury is a crucial component of YLL. The earlier the age at death, the more significant the impact on potential years of life lost.\nLife expectancy: YLL is determined by the expected age at death in a population without disease or injury. This value is used to compare the actual age at death with the expected age at death and determine the number of years of life lost.\nStandard life expectancy: To make comparisons across populations and over time, YLL is often expressed relative to a standard life expectancy, typically set at an age of 70 years.\nPopulation size: The size of the population affected by a disease or injury is another critical component of YLL. A larger population will have a greater impact on overall YLL, regardless of age at death.\nCause of death: The cause of death is also considered when calculating YLL, as different causes may have different impacts on potential years of life lost.\nBy taking these factors into account, YLL provides a measure of the potential years of life lost due to premature death caused by a disease or injury. It is a crucial component of the DALY, which provides a comprehensive view of the overall burden of disease on a population.\n\n\n3.1.1 Life tables and Life expectancy\nTwo fundamental components are used for calculating the metrics:\n\nlife tables\nlife expectancy\n\nBoth of these elements are key for achieving the highest value of prediction of the state of health of a population.\n\n3.1.1.1 Life tables\nThe life tables are selected among the most frequently used, more information about how to build a like table can be found in the Appendix A of this book.\n\nShow the codelibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(infectious)\ninfectious::Glifetables%>%head\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 5\n  indicator                                           age_g…¹ sex    value year \n  <chr>                                               <chr>   <chr>  <dbl> <chr>\n1 nMx - age-specific death rate between ages x and x… 1 year  both  0.0478 2019 \n2 nMx - age-specific death rate between ages x and x… 1 year  male  0.0513 2019 \n3 nMx - age-specific death rate between ages x and x… 1 year  fema… 0.0441 2019 \n4 nMx - age-specific death rate between ages x and x… 1 year  both  0.0566 2015 \n5 nMx - age-specific death rate between ages x and x… 1 year  male  0.0602 2015 \n6 nMx - age-specific death rate between ages x and x… 1 year  fema… 0.0528 2015 \n# … with abbreviated variable name ¹​age_group\n\n\n\nShow the codeGlifetables %>%\n  filter(sex==\"both\",\n         indicator==\"ex - expectation of life at age x\")%>%\n         #age_group==\"1 year\")%>%\n  ggplot(aes(year,value,group=indicator))+\n  geom_line()+\n  facet_wrap(vars(age_group))+\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.1.2 Life expectancy\nThe life expectancy rates are calculated with consideration of the probability of survival based on key parameter such as age, and deaths probabilities for that age.

    "text": "3.2 How to build the metrics\nIn this section a practical calculation of the health metrics is done for the practitioner to be able to replicate this calculation for further analysis based on these key elements.\n\n3.2.1 YLLs\nThe number of years of life lost YLLs is the first of the three metrics that is calculated, and is important for releasing a first look at the status of a population. It is calculated for identifying the area where improvement is required for reducing the loss in health status and clearly reducing the probability of death (see Reiner and Hay 2022)\nThe components of YLL (Years of Life Lost) include several factors that contribute to the calculation of premature death due to a disease or injury. These components are:\nAge at death: The age at which a person died due to a disease or injury is a crucial component of YLL. The earlier the age at death, the greater the impact on potential years of life lost.\nLife expectancy: The expected age at death in a population without the disease or injury is an important component of YLL. This value is used to compare the actual age at death with the expected age at death and determine the number of years of life lost.\nStandard life expectancy: To make comparisons across populations and over time, YLL is often expressed relative to a standard life expectancy, typically set at an age of 70 years.\nPopulation size: The size of the population affected by a disease or injury is another important component of YLL. A larger population will have a greater impact on overall YLL, regardless of the age at death.\nCause of death: The cause of death is also considered when calculating YLL, as different causes may have different impacts on potential years of life lost.\nBy taking these factors into account, YLL provides a measure of the potential years of life lost due to premature death caused by a disease or injury. It is an important component of the DALY, which provides a comprehensive view of the overall burden of disease on a population.\n\n3.2.2 YLDs\nThe components of YLD (Years Lived with Disability) include several factors that contribute to the calculation of the number of years lived with a disability due to a disease or injury. These components are:\nPrevalence: The prevalence of a condition is the number of cases of a particular disease or injury present in a population at a given time. This is an important component of YLD as it determines the number of people who are affected by a disease or injury and the overall impact on the population.\nDisability weight: The disability weight reflects the severity of the disability caused by a disease or injury. It is used to quantify the impact of a condition on quality of life, with higher weights assigned to more severe conditions.\nAge: The age of the person affected by a disease or injury is also considered when calculating YLD. Conditions that occur at an earlier age will have a greater impact on the number of years lived with disability.\nPopulation size: The size of the population affected by a disease or injury is another important component of YLD. A larger population will have a greater impact on overall YLD, regardless of the age of the affected individuals.\nDuration of disability: The duration of disability is also considered when calculating YLD. Conditions that last for a longer period of time will have a greater impact on the number of years lived with disability.\nBy taking these factors into account, YLD provides a measure of the number of years lived with a disability due to a disease or injury. It is an important component of the DALY, which provides a comprehensive view of the overall burden of disease on a population.\n\n3.2.3 DALYs\nBoth YLL and YLD are components of the DALY and are used to provide a comprehensive assessment of the impact of disease and injury on a population. By combining YLL and YLD, the DALY takes into account both premature death and the impact of disease or injury on quality of life, providing a more comprehensive view of the overall burden of disease."

    "text": "3.3 How to use the metrics\nThe health metrics of DALY, YLL, and YLD can be used in several ways to help prioritize public health interventions, evaluate the impact of diseases and injuries, and inform public health decision-making. Some common uses of these metrics include:\nPrioritizing public health interventions: By calculating the overall burden of disease in a population, public health practitioners can prioritize which diseases and injuries to address first. This helps allocate resources and target interventions to the areas of greatest need.\nEvaluating the impact of diseases and injuries: These metrics can be used to measure the impact of diseases and injuries on individuals and populations and to track changes over time. This information can help inform public health decision-making and allocate resources more effectively.\nComparing the burden of disease across populations: DALY, YLL, and YLD can be used to compare the burden of disease across populations and between different regions. This information can help identify disparities in health outcomes and inform targeted public health interventions.\nEvaluating the effectiveness of public health programs: These metrics can be used to evaluate the impact of public health programs and to assess the effectiveness of public health interventions. This information can help public health practitioners identify areas for improvement and make necessary changes to ensure that programs are achieving their goals.\nMonitoring global health trends: DALY, YLL, and YLD can also be used to monitor global health trends and track changes in the burden of disease over time. This information can be used to inform global health policies and allocate resources to address emerging health threats.\nOverall, the health metrics of DALY, YLL, and YLD provide valuable information for public health practitioners, researchers, and policy makers to help prioritize and allocate resources, evaluate the impact of diseases and injuries, and inform public health decision-making.\n\n\n\n\nReiner, Robert C., and Simon I.

    "text": "How to use the metrics\nOverview of the causes and risks\n\nConditions and injuries that are associated with the burden of disease and injury vary according to their specific causes and risks. However, some common causes and risk factors include:\n\nLifestyle choices: Poor diet, physical inactivity, tobacco use, and excessive alcohol consumption are major risk factors for many chronic diseases and injuries, including heart disease, stroke, cancer, and liver disease.\nEnvironmental factors: Exposure to pollutants, such as air pollution and toxic chemicals, can increase the risk of certain diseases and injuries.\nInfections: Many diseases, such as tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, and malaria, are caused by infectious agents.\nPoverty: People living in poverty are often more susceptible to health problems due to limited access to healthcare, healthy food, and safe living conditions.\nAging: As people get older, they are at an increased risk of many health problems, including chronic diseases and disabilities.\nGenetics: Some diseases and injuries are caused by genetic factors, such as a genetic predisposition to certain cancers.\nInjuries: Injuries, such as falls, road traffic accidents, and violence, can also contribute to the burden of diseases and injuries.\n\nA particular health condition can have multiple causes and risk factors. For example, poverty and lack of access to healthcare can increase the risk of infectious diseases, while poor diet and physical inactivity can increase the risk of chronic diseases. Addressing the underlying causes and risk factors for diseases and injuries is a key component of public health interventions and can help reduce the overall burden of disease.\nHere is an example of how the DALY metric can be used for prevention in R:\nSuppose we have data on the number of cases of a particular disease, as well as the average number of years of life lost due to this disease. We can use this information to calculate the total number of DALYs lost due to this disease.\n\nShow the code# Load the library 'dplyr'\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n# Create a data frame with the number of cases and average years of life lost\ndf <- data.frame(cases = c(100, 200, 300),\n                 years_lost = c(5, 10, 15))\n\n# Calculate the number of DALYs lost\ndf <- df %>% mutate(dalys = cases * years_lost)\n\n# Sum the total number of DALYs lost\ntotal_dalys <- sum(df$dalys)\n\n\nIn this example, we first create a data frame with the number of cases of the disease and the average years of life lost for each case. Then, we use the mutate() function from the dplyr library to calculate the number of DALYs lost for each case. Finally, we use the sum() function to find the total number of DALYs lost for the entire population.\nThis information can be used to inform public health interventions to prevent the spread of this disease and reduce the number of DALYs lost. For example, the information could be used to prioritize resources for disease control and prevention activities, such as health education campaigns, vaccination programs, and screening and treatment programs."
