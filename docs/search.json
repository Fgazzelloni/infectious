    "text": "Preface\nHealth metrics and the spread of infectious diseases, with machine learning applications and spatial model analysis are the topics of this book.\nHere you will find everything you need to analyze the state of health of a country and compare it with that of other countries. You will also be able to evaluate the best model for predicting future trends.\nThe author of this book is Federica Gazzelloni who is an actuary and a statistician graduated from the Sapienza of Rome, in Italy. She is also a collaborator of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) , which inspired this work to serve as a guideline for making health metrics and spatial model analysis for evaluating the state of health of a population and spread of infectious diseases.\nAll data used in this book are from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME).

    "text": "Health metrics and the spread of infectious diseases, with machine learning applications and spatial model analysis, is a manual and a textbook for an introductory health data analysis course. It can also turn out to be a useful source code for both practitioners and data scientists.\nPublic health metrics such as DALYs, YLL, and YLD are expressed in numbers of years of life lost or lived with disabilities whose sum expresses a key value generally used for ranking the health status of a population.\nA focus on the impact of recent infectious disease outbreaks, such as Covid19, on the state of health of the population, will be provided along with the most affected locations. The book is structured with an alternation of text and chunks of code in the R language to let the reader be a practitioner of real-world case studies on the topic.\nTo be more specific, the metrics used to summarize the state of health of a population will be compared across other locations and a prediction level tested on a few key models will be provided. The idea is to use {tidymodels}, and {INLA} as modeling tools. Finally, the material contains some interesting spatial visualization, made using {ggplot2}, {leaflet}, {sf}, {rgdal} R packages, plus other main packages for allowing the user for a wider understanding of the potentiality of the R language for both spatial and health metrics.\nThe book is foreseen for practitioners at early stages and graduated students in STEM."

    "text": "Health metrics are key variables to understand more about the state of health of a population. In this book we’ll talk about how to calculate the numbers of years of life lost (YLLs) and the numbers of years lived with disabilities (YLDs), to finally obtain the key metric of the DALYs which identify the numbers of years of life lost due to death or a disability status, namely disability adjusted life years.\n\nThe numbers of years of life lost by a population in comparison to other countries or to the Global mean trend, is based on the latest study results relative to how the well being of a country is in terms of the definition of a healthy life. To give an example, let’s think about a population whose individuals are living a good life, so defined healthy life measured on life expectancy established to be 80 years on average, as most of the World population meets this as a deadline.\nThe part of the population who do not meet this age, but dies earlier, contributes as a building block of the numbers of years of life lost (YLLs), as well as for all that is related with a healthy living, the numbers of years spent dealing with a disability contribute to increasing the numbers of years lived with disabilities for a country’s population.\nTo establish a healthy life status for a country, meant as the healthy life defying the state of health of a population, the sum of the two values YLLs and YLDs releases the key metric of DALYs. This metric value is used to quickly identify the level of health of a population compared to a Global review based on the latest findings of the most updated studies.\nIn addition, this level is used to improve the proportion of countries who are in need of a better health status recognition. To be more specific, the focus on the numbers of years can help identify the areas where most of the years are lost and need for improvement, whether in facilities, research or investments.\nAn improvement of health at a Global level is reached when the definition of a healthy file is met in most of the countries where it wasn’t before.\nFurthermore, what we want to analyze are a series of data that are produced taking into account the tables of mortality and future life expectancy these are defined as means that these metrics have been considered important for assessing the state of health of one point population\nWhat we refer to are the health metrics and which refer to the number of years lost due to an increase in mortality or in any case to a mortality trend that is above a certain general level which we can consider as the level optimal health globally."

The result of the review shown a steady improvement of the DALY metrics in almost all countries of Europe. Cardiovascular and neoplasms account for most of deaths and increase in numbers of years lost in EU 2019. Important improvements in some areas (e.g. transport injuries) are opposite ar the increasing level of diabetes spread in the population."
