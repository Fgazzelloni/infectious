    "text": "Health metrics and the spread of infectious diseases, with machine learning applications and spatial model analysis, is a manual and a textbook for an introductory health data analysis course. It can also turn out to be a useful source code for both practitioners and data scientists.\nPublic health metrics such as DALYs, YLL, and YLD are expressed in numbers of years of life lost or lived with disabilities whose sum expresses a key value generally used for ranking the health status of a population.\nA focus on the impact of recent infectious disease outbreaks, such as Covid19, on the state of health of the population, will be provided along with the most affected locations. The book is structured with an alternation of text and chunks of code in the R language to let the reader be a practitioner of real-world case studies on the topic.\nTo be more specific, the metrics used to summarize the state of health of a population will be compared across other locations and a prediction level tested on a few key models will be provided. The idea is to use {tidymodels}, and {INLA} as modeling tools. Finally, the material contains some interesting spatial visualization, made using {ggplot2}, {leaflet}, {sf}, {rgdal} R packages, plus other main packages for allowing the user for a wider understanding of the potentiality of the R language for both spatial and health metrics.\nThe book is foreseen for practitioners at early stages and graduated students in STEM."

    "text": "Health metrics are key variables to understand more about the state of health of a population. In this book we’ll talk about how to calculate the numbers of years of life lost (YLLs) and the numbers of years lived with disabilities (YLDs), to finally obtain the key metric of the DALYs which identify the numbers of years of life lost due to death or a disability status, namely disability adjusted life years.\n\nThe numbers of years of life lost by a population in comparison to other countries or to the Global mean trend, is based on the latest study results relative to how the well being of a country is in terms of the definition of a healthy life. To give an example, let’s think about a population whose individuals are living a good life, so defined healthy life measured on life expectancy established to be 80 years on average, as most of the World population meets this as a deadline.\nThe part of the population who do not meet this age, but dies earlier, contributes as a building block of the numbers of years of life lost (YLLs), as well as for all that is related with a healthy living, the numbers of years spent dealing with a disability contribute to increasing the numbers of years lived with disabilities for a country’s population.\nTo establish a healthy life status for a country, meaning the state of health of a population, the sum of the two values YLLs and YLDs is used to obtain the key metric of DALYs. This metric value is used to quickly identify the level of health of a population compared to a Global review based on the latest findings of the most updated studies.\nIn addition, this level is used to improve the proportion of countries who are in need of a better health status recognition. To be more specific, the focus on the numbers of years can help identify the areas where most of the years are lost and need for improvement, whether in facilities, research or investments.\nAn improvement of health at a Global level is reached when the definition of a healthy file is met in most of the countries where it wasn’t before.\nFurthermore, what we want to analyze are a series of data that are produced taking into account the tables of mortality and future life expectancy these are defined as means that these metrics have been considered important for assessing the state of health of one point population\nWhat we refer to are the health metrics and which refer to the number of years lost due to an increase in mortality or in any case to a mortality trend that is above a certain general level which we can consider as the level optimal health globally."

    "text": "How to use the metrics\nOverview of the causes and risks\n\nConditions and injuries that are associated with the burden of disease and injury vary according to their specific causes and risks. However, some common causes and risk factors include:\n\nLifestyle choices: Poor diet, physical inactivity, tobacco use, and excessive alcohol consumption are major risk factors for many chronic diseases and injuries, including heart disease, stroke, cancer, and liver disease.\nEnvironmental factors: Exposure to pollutants, such as air pollution and toxic chemicals, can increase the risk of certain diseases and injuries.\nInfections: Many diseases, such as tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, and malaria, are caused by infectious agents.\nPoverty: People living in poverty are often more susceptible to health problems due to limited access to healthcare, healthy food, and safe living conditions.\nAging: As people get older, they are at an increased risk of many health problems, including chronic diseases and disabilities.\nGenetics: Some diseases and injuries are caused by genetic factors, such as a genetic predisposition to certain cancers.\nInjuries: Injuries, such as falls, road traffic accidents, and violence, can also contribute to the burden of diseases and injuries.\n\n\nA particular health condition can have multiple causes and risk factors. For example, poverty and lack of access to healthcare can increase the risk of infectious diseases, while poor diet and physical inactivity can increase the risk of chronic diseases. Addressing the underlying causes and risk factors for diseases and injuries is a key component of public health interventions and can help reduce the overall burden of disease.\nAs an example here is shown how the DALY metric can be used for prevention:\nSuppose we have data on the number of cases of a particular disease, as well as the average number of years of life lost due to this disease. We can use this information to calculate the total number of DALYs lost due to this disease.\n\nShow the code# Load the library 'dplyr'\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n# Create a data frame with the number of cases and average years of life lost\ndf <- data.frame(YLL = c(5, 10, 15),\n                 YLD = c(1,3,4))\n\n# Calculate the number of DALYs lost\ndf <- df %>% mutate(DALY = YLL + YLD)\n\n# Sum the total number of DALYs lost\ntotal_dalys <- sum(df$DALY)\ntotal_dalys\n\n[1] 38\n\n\nIn this example, the number of cases of the disease and the average years of life lost for each case are used to calculate the number of DALYs lost for each case. Finally, the total number of DALYs lost for the entire population.\nThis information can be used to inform public health interventions to prevent the spread of this disease and reduce the number of DALYs lost. For example, the information could be used to prioritize resources for disease control and prevention activities, such as health education campaigns, vaccination programs, and screening and treatment programs."

It is a composite measure that combines years of life expectancy with a measure of the prevalence and severity of disability in a population. HALE provides a more comprehensive view of health outcomes than traditional measures of life expectancy, which only consider the quantity of life.\nThe calculation of HALE typically involves estimating the number of years that an individual can expect to live in good health, taking into account the impact of diseases and injuries on quality of life. This information is then used to estimate the overall health status of a population.\nHALE is a useful tool for public health practitioners and policy makers, as it provides a more nuanced view of the health outcomes of a population. This information can help inform public health interventions and prioritize resources, as well as help track changes in health outcomes over time. Additionally, HALE can be used to compare the health outcomes of different populations and identify disparities in health outcomes, which can help inform targeted public health interventions.\nOverall, the HALE metric provides a valuable perspective on the overall health and well-being of a population, combining information about both quantity and quality of life to provide a comprehensive view of health outcomes.\nIt adjusts overall life expectancy by the amount of time lived in less than perfect health. This is calculated by subtracting from the life expectancy a figure which is the number of years lived with disability multiplied by a weighting to represent the effect of the disability.1\nMore info 2"

    "text": "Model description\nThis book aims at providing a simple explanation at how to model a fast growing phenomenon such as in the case of the spread of infectious diseases. In addition, a further look will be provided at the evolution of the infection in some specific countries.\nA stochastic process, or random process (see Dobrow 2016) is the type of model which attempt to replicate uncertain outcomes. At opposite, in a deterministic system the outcome is obtained from a given input, and for this reason it is reproducible.\nThe spread of a virus can be seen as a random process, since the number of individuals who are infected at any given time can change randomly. The exact number of individuals who will be infected in the future cannot be determined with certainty, since it depends on various factors such as the contagiousness of the virus, the behavior of individuals, and the efficacy of mitigation measures.\nA deterministic model, on the other hand, could be used to model the spread of a virus under certain conditions, such as a fixed number of individuals, constant contagiousness, and no mitigation measures. This type of model can be used to make predictions about the spread of a virus under certain assumptions, but it will not account for the randomness and uncertainty associated with real-world scenarios.\nMost models used to study the spread of a virus are a combination of both deterministic and stochastic models. For example, the SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) model is a deterministic model that describes the dynamics of the spread of a virus, but it also includes stochastic elements such as random interactions between individuals.\nThe spread of COVID-19\nHere is a model example of the spread of COVID-19 using a stochastic process. In this example, we’ll use a simple SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered) model to simulate the spread of the virus in a population. The SEIR model divides a population into four compartments based on their status with respect to the virus: susceptible, exposed, infected, and recovered.\nFirst, we’ll load the necessary packages and define some parameters for our model:\n\nShow the codelibrary(deSolve)\n\n# Define parameters\nN <- 1e6  # Total population\nbeta <- 0.5  # Transmission rate\ngamma <- 0.1  # Recovery rate\nt_exp <- 5  # Latent period\n\n# Initial conditions\ninit <- c(S = N - 1, E = 1, I = 0, R = 0)\n\n# Define the SEIR model\nseir_model <- function(t, y, parameters) {\n  with(as.list(y), {\n    dS <- -beta * S * I / N\n    dE <- beta * S * I / N - (1 / t_exp) * E\n    dI <- (1 / t_exp) * E - gamma * I\n    dR <- gamma * I\n    return(list(c(dS, dE, dI, dR)))\n  })\n}\n\n\nNext, we’ll use the ode function from the deSolve package to solve the ODEs and simulate the spread of the virus over a period of 365 days:\n\nShow the code# Solve the ODEs\ntimes <- seq(0, 365, by = 1)\nresult <- ode(y = init, times = times, func = seir_model)\n\n# Plot the results\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nggplot(as.data.frame(result), aes(time, I, color = \"Infected\")) +\n  geom_line() +\n  geom_line(aes(time, R, color = \"Recovered\")) +\n  geom_line(aes(time, S, color = \"Susceptible\")) +\n  geom_line(aes(time, E, color = \"Exposed\")) +\n  scale_color_discrete(name = \"Compartment\") +\n  labs(x = \"Time (days)\", y = \"Number of individuals\") +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\nIn this example, many factors are not taken into account. In reality, the spread of a virus is much more complex and influenced by many factors such as human behavior, government policies, and healthcare systems.\n\n\n\n\nDobrow, Robert P. 2016.

There are several methods to calculate life expectancy, but one common approach is to use the actuarial life table, which is a statistical table that provides the mortality rates for a population at different ages. The following steps can be used to calculate life expectancy using a life table:\nIdentify the relevant mortality rates for the population and time period of interest. Calculate the probability of surviving to each age, given the mortality rates. Multiply the probability of surviving to each age by the remaining life expectancy at that age to obtain the expected number of years of life remaining at each age. Sum the expected number of years of life remaining at each age to obtain the total life expectancy. Note that life expectancy is a statistical estimate and can be influenced by many factors, such as lifestyle, health, and environmental factors, so actual individual life expectancies can vary widely.\nHere are some key references for calculating life expectancy:\n\nUnited Nations World Population Prospects - The UN provides detailed life tables and population data, including life expectancy, for countries and regions around the world.\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) - The CDC provides life tables for the United States, as well as information on how life expectancy is calculated and factors that affect it.\nWorld Health Organization (WHO) - The WHO provides information on global health and life expectancy, including data and reports on trends in life expectancy and mortality.\nActuarial Science textbooks - Books such as “Actuarial Mathematics” by Bowers, Gerber, Hickman, Jones, and Nesbitt, or “An Introduction to Actuarial Mathematics” by Michel Millar, provide comprehensive coverage of the methods and mathematics used in calculating life expectancy.\nJournal articles - Articles in actuarial and demographic journals, such as the North American Actuarial Journal or Demographic Research, often provide in-depth coverage of the latest research and methods for calculating life expectancy.\n\n\n\n\n\nKovacheva, Ts.
