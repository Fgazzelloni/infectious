# YLLs, YLDs and DALYs {#sec-ch11Metrics}

-   A closer look at the metrics, their usage and potentiality for improvements

In this section are shown the methods used for building three key metrics: YLLs, YLDs and DALYs. These will be used throughout the book for making comparisons among the state of health of different countries.

The health metrics, and their components are used to measure the burden of disease and quantify the impact of diseases and injuries on individuals and populations. These metrics can help prioritize public health interventions and evaluate the effectiveness of public health programs.

## YLL (Years of Life Lost)

YLL (Years of Life Lost) measures the number of years a person would have lived if they had not died prematurely due to a disease or injury. YLL is calculated by subtracting the age at death from the expected age at death in a population without the disease or injury.

## YLD (Years Lived with Disability)

YLD (Years Lived with Disability) measures the number of years a person lives with a disability due to a disease or injury. It is calculated by multiplying the prevalence of a condition by the disability weight, which reflects the severity of the disability.

## DALY (Disability-Adjusted Life Year)

DALY (Disability-Adjusted Life Year) is a measure of overall disease burden and is calculated as the sum of years of potential life lost due to premature death (YLL) and years lived with disability (YLD). The DALY takes into account both the quantity and quality of life lost due to disease or injury.

The YLL and YLD are components of the DALY, which are used to assess how diseases and injuries impact populations. As a result, \@sec-ch12Components section provides a more comprehensive picture of the overall burden of disease by combining YLLs and YLDs in different life expectancy groups.
