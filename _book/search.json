    "text": "Health metrics and the spread of infectious diseases, with machine learning applications and spatial model analysis, is a manual and a textbook for an introductory health data analysis course. It can also turn out to be a useful source code for both practitioners and data scientists.\nPublic health metrics such as DALYs, YLL, and YLD are expressed in numbers of years of life lost or lived with disabilities whose sum expresses a key value generally used for ranking the health status of a population.\nA focus on the impact of recent infectious disease outbreaks, such as Covid19, on the state of health of the population, will be provided along with the most affected locations. The book is structured with an alternation of text and chunks of code in the R language to let the reader be a practitioner of real-world case studies on the topic.\nTo be more specific, the metrics used to summarize the state of health of a population will be compared across other locations and a prediction level tested on a few key models will be provided. The idea is to use {tidymodels}, and {INLA} as modeling tools. Finally complete the material some interesting spatial visualization, made with using {ggplot2}, {leaflet}, {sf}, {rgdal} R packages, plus other main packages for allowing the user for a wider understanding of the potentiality of the R language for both spatial and health metrics.\nThe book is foreseen for practitioners at early stages and graduated students in STEM."

    "text": "Health metrics are key variables to understand more about the state of health of a population. In this book we’ll talk about numbers of years of life lost (YLLs) and the numbers of years lived with disabilities (YLDs), to finally identify the key metric of the DALYs which means disability adjusted life years.\nThe numbers of years of life lost by a population in comparison to other population in a different country or to the Global mean trend is what is expected it should be based on the latest study results relative to the well being of a country in terms of the definition of a healthy life. To give an example, let’s think about a population whose individuals are living a good life, so defined healthy life measured on life expectancy established to be 80 years on average, as most of the World population meets this as a deadline.\nThe part of the population who do not meet this age, but dies earlier, contributes to building blocks of the numbers of years of life lost (YLLs), as well as for all that is related with a healthy living, the numbers of years spent dealing with a disability of different kind contribute to increasing the numbers of years lived with disabilities for a country’s population.\nTo establish the well being, meant as the healthy life defying the state of health of a population, based on the latest findings of the most updated studies, the sum of these two values YLLs and YLDs releases the key metric of DALYs. This metric value is used to quickly identify the level of health of a population compared to a Global review.\nIn addition, this level is used to improve the proportion of countries who are in need of a better health status recognition. To be more specific, the focus on the numbers of years can help identify the areas where most of the years are lost and need for improvement, whether in facilities, research or investments.\nAn improvement of health at a Global level is reached when the definition of a healthy file is met in most of the countries where it wasn’t before."
