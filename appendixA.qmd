# Life tables and Life expectancy {#sec-appendixA}

Back in the 1700s the Swiss mathematician and physicist Daniel Bernoulli (1700 - 1782) developed the use of a life table model by differentiating life tables based on specific causes of death [see @kovacheva2017, and @lifetab].

Originally made by the English scientist John Graunt (1620-1674), for the analysis of the mortality of the population of London and the impact of different diseases.

Life tables contain fundamental statistics for the calculation of probabilities of deaths and the computation of life expectancy at birth and at different ages.

### Life tables components

More recent life tables are standardized to be used for a population of 100 000 at age 0.

$l_x$ survivors at age $x$ it starts with a value of 100 000

$d_x$ deceased at age $x$

$q_x$ probability of deaths

$p_x$ probability of survive

$$p_x=1-q_x$$

Let's start constructing a life table

```{r}
#| warning: false
#| message: false
library(tidyverse)
infectious::Glifetables %>%
  count(indicator)
```

```{r}
lx <- infectious::Glifetables %>%
  distinct() %>%
  filter(indicator == "lx - number of people left alive at age x",
         year == "2019")
```

```{r}
x <- lx %>% 
  filter(sex == "female") %>% 
  select(x = age_group)

lx_f <- lx %>% 
  filter(sex == "female") %>% 
  select(lx = value)

lx_m <- lx %>% 
  filter(sex == "male") %>% 
  select(lx = value)

px = lx_f$lx / lag(lx_f$lx)
```

```{r}
data.frame(
  x,
  lx = round(lx_f),
  dx = round(c(-diff(lx_f$lx), 0)),
  px,
  qx = 1 - lead(px),
  Lx = c((lx_f$lx[1] + (lx_f$lx[2])) / 2,
         5 * (lx_f$lx[-1] + lead(lx_f$lx[-1])) / 2)
) %>% head
```

```{r}
infectious::Glifetables %>%
  distinct() %>%
  filter(
    indicator == "nLx - person-years lived between ages x and x+n",
    year == "2019",
    sex == "female"
  )
```

## Life expectancy

Life expectancy is the expected number of years a person will live, based on current age and prevailing mortality rates. There are several methods to calculate life expectancy, but one common approach is to use the actuarial life table, which is a statistical table that provides the mortality rates for a population at different ages. The following steps can be used to calculate life expectancy using a life table:

Identify the relevant mortality rates for the population and time period of interest. Calculate the probability of surviving to each age, given the mortality rates. Multiply the probability of surviving to each age by the remaining life expectancy at that age to obtain the expected number of years of life remaining at each age. Sum the expected number of years of life remaining at each age to obtain the total life expectancy. Note that life expectancy is a statistical estimate and can be influenced by many factors, such as lifestyle, health, and environmental factors, so actual individual life expectancies can vary widely.

Here are some key references for calculating life expectancy:

1.  United Nations World Population Prospects - The UN provides detailed life tables and population data, including life expectancy, for countries and regions around the world.

2.  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) - The CDC provides life tables for the United States, as well as information on how life expectancy is calculated and factors that affect it.

3.  World Health Organization (WHO) - The WHO provides information on global health and life expectancy, including data and reports on trends in life expectancy and mortality.

4.  Actuarial Science textbooks - Books such as "Actuarial Mathematics" by Bowers, Gerber, Hickman, Jones, and Nesbitt, or "An Introduction to Actuarial Mathematics" by Michel Millar, provide comprehensive coverage of the methods and mathematics used in calculating life expectancy.

5.  Journal articles - Articles in actuarial and demographic journals, such as the North American Actuarial Journal or Demographic Research, often provide in-depth coverage of the latest research and methods for calculating life expectancy.
