-   Description and calculation

## HALE (Healthy Life Expectancy)

The health metric of HALE (Healthy Life Expectancy) is a measure of overall health and well-being that takes into account both quantity and quality of life. It is a composite measure that combines years of life expectancy with a measure of the prevalence and severity of disability in a population. HALE provides a more comprehensive view of health outcomes than traditional measures of life expectancy, which only consider the quantity of life.

The calculation of HALE typically involves estimating the number of years that an individual can expect to live in good health, taking into account the impact of diseases and injuries on quality of life. This information is then used to estimate the overall health status of a population.

HALE is a useful tool for public health practitioners and policy makers, as it provides a more nuanced view of the health outcomes of a population. This information can help inform public health interventions and prioritize resources, as well as help track changes in health outcomes over time. Additionally, HALE can be used to compare the health outcomes of different populations and identify disparities in health outcomes, which can help inform targeted public health interventions.

Overall, the HALE metric provides a valuable perspective on the overall health and well-being of a population, combining information about both quantity and quality of life to provide a comprehensive view of health outcomes.

It adjusts overall life expectancy by the amount of time lived in less than perfect health. This is calculated by subtracting from the life expectancy a figure which is the number of years lived with disability multiplied by a weighting to represent the effect of the disability.[^ch14metrics2-1]
