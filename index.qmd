Health metrics and the spread of infectious diseases, with machine learning applications and spatial model analysis are the topics of this book.

Here you will find everything you need to analyze the state of health of a country and compare it with that of other countries. You will also be able to evaluate the best model for predicting future trends.

The author of this book is **Federica Gazzelloni** who is an actuary and a statistician graduated from the Sapienza of Rome, in Italy.
